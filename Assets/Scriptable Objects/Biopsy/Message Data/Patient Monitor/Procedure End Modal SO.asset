  Title: 
  Description: "The procedure is over. You continue to observe your patient as they
    emerge from sedation. You notice they can protect their airway. You remove their
    bite block. They slowly open their eyes when you call their name. Their SpO2
    remains high, so you wean/discontinue the oxygen. Vitals signs remain within
    defined limits. End-of-scenario. Congratulations. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to your
    facilitator for next steps for debriefing."
