  ExplorableName: Bacterial Viral Filter
  ExplorableDescription: "The bacterial viral filter with luer lock is used in combination
    with the bag valve mask. The filter is designed to trap bacteria and viruses,
    preventing them from passing through the mask and into the patient's airway.
    \n\nBy filtering out pathogens, it also reduces the risk of contamination to
    health care providers providing bag mask ventilation.\r"
